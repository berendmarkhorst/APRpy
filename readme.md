`APRpy` is an abbreviation for Automated Pipe Routing in Python.
We have made an exact pipe routing method that, amongst others, includes multi-pipe routing and branching, while
minimizing the number of bends and the length of the pipes. In addition, we have made several instances based
on the literature that can serve as benchmarks for future research in this field.

The `APRpy` package depends only on `numpy`, `highspy`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib` packages. It can be installed
through `pip` by running the following command:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

We'll include more documentation here as the project grows!
