`APRpy` is an abbreviation for Automated Pipe Routing in Python.
We have made an exact pipe routing method that, amongst others, includes multi-pipe routing and branching, while
minimizing the number of bends and the length of the pipes. In addition, we have made several instances based
on the literature that can serve as benchmarks for future research in this field.

The `APRpy` package depends only on `numpy`, `highspy`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib` packages. It can be installed
through `pip` by running the following command:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```
## Defining an Instance via JSON

### üìÑ JSON Format for Defining Pipe Routing Instances

`APRpy` allows users to define benchmark or custom pipe routing problems through a structured JSON file. This makes it easy to define multiple pipes, obstacles, and routing targets in a human-readable and editable format.

#### üîß General Structure
```json
{
  "name": "your_instance_name",
  "size": integer,
  "obstacles": [...],
  "pipes": [...]
}
```
#### Fields Breakdown
`name` (string)

A descriptive name for the instance, used for identification.

`size` (integer)

The size of the cubic 3D grid, i.e., the routing space is `[0, size-1]^3`.

`obstacles` (list of lists of integers)

Each obstacle is defined by a bounding box using 6 integers:

`[x_min, y_min, z_min, x_max, y_max, z_max]`

These define a **closed rectangular volume** in 3D space where routing is not allowed. All coordinates are zero-based and inclusive on both ends (Python-style slicing is used internally).

`pipes` (list of pipe objects)
Each pipe has the following fields:

- `id` (integer)

A unique identifier for the pipe.

- `diameter` (number, optional)

Currently unused in the core routing model, but can be used for visualization, postprocessing, or future extensions.

- `costs` (number)

The per-unit cost associated with routing this pipe.

`connected_components` (list of connected component objects)

Each connected component defines a group of terminals that must be connected via this pipe.

Connected Components

Each connected component has:

- `id` (integer)

A unique identifier for the connected component within the pipe.

- `terminals` (list of 3D coordinate lists)

A list of terminal points (e.g., start and end of a pipe, but can be more than two). All terminals must lie within the routing grid and outside any obstacles.

- `forbidden_nodes` (optional list of 3D coordinate lists)

A list of nodes (grid points) that cannot be used for this component, even if they are not part of an obstacle.

### ‚ùó Modeling Assumption: No Terminal Overlap
In `APRpy`, terminals must be unique across all connected components, even across different pipes. This means no two connected components (whether from the same or different pipes) may share a terminal point.

This assumption simplifies the mathematical model and avoids ambiguity during routing. If overlapping terminals are defined, an exception will be raised when initializing the model.

### ‚úÖ Example
```json
{
  "name": "jiang_etall_case1",
  "size": 40,
  "obstacles": [
    [5, 11, 0, 23, 15, 39],
    [31, 11, 0, 39, 15, 39]
  ],
  "pipes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "diameter": 1,
      "costs": 1,
      "connected_components": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "terminals": [
            [19, 0, 0],
            [19, 39, 39]
          ],
          "forbidden_nodes": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
